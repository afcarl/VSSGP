Variational Sparse Spectrum Gaussian Process toolkit (VSSGP)
====

This is the implementaion of the inference developed in "[Variational Inference for Sparse Spectrum Approximation in Gaussian Process Regression](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/yarin/publications.html#Gal2015Variational)". Please see the paper for further details.

This code assumes that the Theano repository was cloned in the parent folder. To clone the repo, run:
```
git clone https://github.com/Theano/Theano.git
```

To run the example file, execute:
```
python VSSGP_example.py
```

Note that Theano will compile the code the first time the example is run, which might take some time.
